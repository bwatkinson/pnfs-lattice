 * mountd_compat.h — Compatibility responder for `showmount -e`.
 *
 * The MDS is an NFSv4.1 / pNFS server: it does NOT speak the NFSv3
 * MOUNT protocol and does NOT serve NFSv3 data.  However, many
 * operators reach for `showmount -e <host>` as a sanity check that
 * the server is exporting anything at all.  When asked of an MDS
 * today, that command fails with "RPC: Program not registered",
 * which causes spurious "is the MDS broken?" tickets.
 *
 * This module starts a tiny ONC-RPC listener that answers MOUNT3
 * (program 100005, version 3) procedures NULL, EXPORT and DUMP with
 * a synthetic, MDS-defined response, and rejects every other
 * procedure with PROC_UNAVAIL.  Specifically, MNT (proc 1) — the
 * only procedure that would yield a usable v3 file handle — is
 * always rejected at the RPC layer, so a client cannot accidentally
 * mount the MDS over NFSv3.
 *
 * It does NOT proxy any request to a Data Server.  The export list
 * is whatever the operator configured in mds.conf, defaulting to a
 * single entry "/".  No DS hostnames, IPs, or paths are ever
 * advertised.
 *
 * See docs/mountd-compat.md for the full design and threat model.
