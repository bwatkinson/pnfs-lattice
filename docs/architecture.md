# Lattice Architecture
Lattice is a parallel NFS (pNFS, RFC 8881 / RFC 7862) metadata server.  It speaks
NFSv4.1 and NFSv4.2 to clients on the front end and routes bulk file I/O around
itself by handing clients a layout that points at one or more data servers
(DSes).  The metadata is kept in a transactional, shared-nothing key-value
store (RonDB / NDB) so that several Lattice daemons can serve the same namespace
simultaneously without a coordinator.
This document describes the architecture as it stands in the source tree.  It
is intended for contributors and operators who need to understand how the
pieces fit together before touching code.
## 1. Goals and non-goals
### Goals
- **Active-active metadata.**  Any number of Lattice daemons can serve the same
  filesystem at the same time.  There is no leader, no global lock service,
  and no fail-over event between daemons.
- **Out-of-band data.**  Clients never read or write file payload through the
  MDS.  The MDS only mints layouts; the data path is client → DS over NFSv3
  (flex-files) or NFSv4.1 file layout.
- **Correctness over throughput.**  Every namespace mutation is a single
  transactional operation in the catalogue.  Concurrent OPEN, CREATE, RENAME,
  REMOVE, LINK between daemons cannot lose updates or produce torn reads.
- **Operability on commodity hardware.**  No special kernel modules, no
  custom hardware, no kernel patches.  RonDB and the standard Linux NFS
  stack are sufficient.
### Non-goals
- **Embedded local metadata.**  Lattice does not store authoritative metadata
  on local disk.  Stateless on restart; the catalogue is the source of truth.
- **Block storage / direct-attached striping.**  Lattice is a metadata service.
  Stripe placement is calculated by the MDS but the actual blocks live on
  data servers that present a regular file-per-stripe interface.
- **Cross-cluster replication / DR.**  A single Lattice deployment is one
  RonDB cluster.  Cross-cluster replication is delegated to RonDB's own
  binlog tooling and is out of Lattice's scope.
## 2. System view
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph clients[NFS clients]
        c1[Linux pNFS client]
        c2[Linux pNFS client]
    end
    subgraph mds[Lattice MDS cluster]
        m1[lattice-pnfs 1]
        m2[lattice-pnfs 2]
        m3[lattice-pnfs N]
    end
    subgraph ndb[RonDB cluster]
        ndbA[(NDB data node)]
        ndbB[(NDB data node)]
        ndbC[(NDB data node)]
    end
    subgraph ds[Data servers]
        d1[DS 1 NFSv3/4.1]
        d2[DS 2 NFSv3/4.1]
        d3[DS N NFSv3/4.1]
    end
    clients -- "RPC: NFSv4.1/4.2" --> mds
    mds -- "NDB API\n(transactional KV)" --> ndb
    clients -- "NFS READ/WRITE\n(layout-directed)" --> ds
    mds -- "GC unlink, prepare,\nplacement probes" --> ds
```
A request flows like this:
1. Client mounts the export and walks the namespace via LOOKUP / GETATTR.
2. On OPEN, the MDS returns a stateid; on the immediate LAYOUTGET it returns
   a flex-files or file layout pointing at one or more DSes.
3. Client sends NFS READ / WRITE directly to those DSes.
4. On CLOSE, LAYOUTRETURN releases the layout state.
The MDS never sees data bytes during the steady state.  The MDS does see
COMMITs and SETATTR(size=...) which it persists to the catalogue.
## 3. Process model
A single Lattice binary (`lattice-pnfs`, `src/mds/main.c`) runs as one Linux
process per node.  Inside that process there is no fork: every subsystem is
threads sharing one address space.
| Thread group | Source | Role |
|---|---|---|
| RPC listeners | `src/mds/rpc_server.c` | One per configured listen socket; accepts RPC connections, decodes NFSv4 COMPOUND, hands work to the worker pool. |
| Compound workers | `src/mds/rpc_server.c`, `compound.c` | Pool that runs `compound_process()` end-to-end for one COMPOUND request. |
| Catalogue I/O threads | `src/catalogue/catalogue_rondb_shim.cpp` | Bound to NDB cluster connections; drive transactions on behalf of compound workers. |
| Commit queue | `src/mds/commit_queue.c` | Optional batched-write path that coalesces small NDB writes (inline data, dirent updates) into larger transactions. |
| Layout recall | `src/mds/layout_recall.c` | CB_LAYOUTRECALL deliveries on the back-channel. |
| DS GC | `src/mds/ds_gc.c` | Coordinator + worker pool; drains the GC queue (orphan stripe rows from final-unlink) and issues NFS UNLINK to the DSes. |
| DS pre-allocator | `src/mds/ds_prealloc.c` | Refills a small per-DS lookahead pool of stripe coordinates so OPEN(create)+LAYOUTGET hits no NDB pre-write. |
| DS health | `src/mds/ds_health.c` | Periodic NFS NULL probe + LAYOUTERROR aggregation; feeds placement. |
| Cluster transport | `src/cluster/cluster_transport.c` | gRPC peer messaging for cross-MDS cache invalidation, hard-link 2PC, etc. |
| Sessions / DRC | `src/mds/session.c` | NFSv4.1 session table, slot tables, replay cache. |
| Backchannel | `src/mds/nfs4_cb.c` | CB_COMPOUND encoder + transport for CB_RECALL, CB_LAYOUTRECALL, CB_NOTIFY. |
| Metrics | `src/mds/metrics_http.c` | HTTP `/metrics` endpoint (Prometheus text format). |
The worker pool is sized by `worker_threads` (config); the listener pool by
`listener_threads`.  All other threads are singletons or small fixed pools.

The boundary between `mds/` and the rest is intentional.  `mds/` knows about
NFSv4 ops; everything below is protocol-agnostic and could in principle be
reused by a different front end.
## 5. Compound processing
Every NFSv4.1/4.2 client request is a COMPOUND containing one or more ops.
The processing pipeline is:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[RPC listener\naccept + decode] --> B[Worker pool\nXDR decode + auth]
    B --> C[compound_init\nbuild compound_data]
    C --> D[per-op dispatch\nop_open / op_read / ...]
    D --> E[encode result\nXDR + RPC reply]
    D -. on mutate .-> F[catalogue txn\nsingle NDB commit]
    D -. on layout .-> G[placement\n+ stripe map write]
```
### `compound_data`
A short-lived per-request struct (`include/compound.h`) that holds:
- The current and saved file handles (FH).
- A small inline cache of the inode for current/saved FH (so a sequence
  PUTFH+GETATTR doesn't re-read the catalogue).
- Pointers to the long-lived subsystem handles: catalogue, sessions,
  open-state table, lock table, delegation tables, caches, quota, shard
  map, subtree map, cluster transport.
- Caller credentials (AUTH_SYS uid/gid + supplementary GIDs).
- A per-request notion of "current shard" used by sharded deployments.
The struct is rebuilt fresh per COMPOUND.  Any state that must outlive a
compound lives in one of the long-lived subsystems it points at.
### Request memory model (Wave-2 heap scratch)
Each worker thread owns calloc'd slot arrays of 64 `nfs4_op` and 64
`nfs4_result` (`rpc_server.c`).  Large payloads — READ/READ_PLUS data,
GETXATTR/LISTXATTRS values, the READDIR page, WRITE/WRITE_SAME/SETXATTR
argument bytes — are NOT inlined in those unions: each slot carries a
scratch block OUTSIDE the union (`nfs4_result_scratch` /
`nfs4_op_scratch`) that owns grow-once buffers allocated lazily at the
payload's protocol maximum, and the union arms hold only borrowed
pointer mirrors set by the `nfs4_*_ensure_*()` helpers.  Ownership
outside the union means an arm switch between compounds can never leak
a buffer and resets never save or restore pointers.
Per op, `compound_process` runs `nfs4_result_destroy()` (frees
layoutget's per-request arrays under the stored opnum) and then
`nfs4_result_reset()`, which zeroes exactly the incoming op's union arm
— status-only ops zero nothing.  The pre-Wave-2 model inlined worst
cases (524 KB per result slot, ~37 MB scratch per worker, a full-union
memset per op); post-Wave-2 a result slot is ~13 KB, an op slot ~4 KB,
and a `_Static_assert` ceiling keeps new payloads from silently
regrowing the union instead of using the scratch.
### Per-op dispatch
Op handlers are split across files by topic:
- `compound_namespace.c` — ACCESS, PUTFH/PUTROOTFH/SAVEFH/RESTOREFH/GETFH,
  LOOKUP/LOOKUPP, GETATTR/SETATTR, CREATE/REMOVE/RENAME/LINK, READDIR,
  READLINK.
- `compound_data_io.c` — OPEN/CLOSE, READ/WRITE, IO_ADVISE, COMMIT, the
  delegation grant point, and inline-data promotion.
- `compound_layout.c` — LAYOUTGET, LAYOUTCOMMIT, LAYOUTRETURN,
  GETDEVICEINFO, LAYOUTERROR, LAYOUTSTATS.
- `compound_session.c` — EXCHANGE_ID, CREATE_SESSION, SEQUENCE,
  DESTROY_SESSION, BIND_CONN_TO_SESSION, RECLAIM_COMPLETE.
- `compound_nfsv42.c` — ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, COPY/COPY_NOTIFY/CLONE/SEEK,
  xattr ops.
- `compound.c` — top-level dispatcher and helpers (`compound_process`,
  `compound_inode_get`, snapshot invalidation).
Each op returns an `enum nfs4_status`; the encoder (`xdr_codec.c`) turns the
result union into a wire reply.
## 6. Catalogue (metadata backend)
Lattice abstracts its metadata store behind a small C ABI in
`include/mds_catalogue.h`.  Two backends ship in tree:
- **RonDB / NDB** (production) — `src/catalogue/catalogue_rondb_shim.cpp`
  wraps the NDB C++ API behind a narrow C surface.  The shim opens NDB
  cluster connections, manages a per-thread `Ndb` object, and exposes a
  one-call-one-transaction interface to the rest of Lattice.
- **memdb** (tests) — `src/catalogue/catalogue_memdb.c` is an in-memory
  hash-table backend used by the unit tests so the suite has no external
  dependency.
Both backends implement the same vtable (`include/catalogue_internal.h`).
Tables (logical, not literal NDB DDL):
| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `inodes` | Per-inode attributes (mode, owner, size, change, parent_fileid). |
| `dirents` | Parent-fileid + name → child fileid + type. |
| `stripe_maps` | Per-file layout: stripe count, mirror count, ordered (ds_id, FH) list. |
| `inline_data` | Small-file payload + symlink targets. |
| `xattrs` | RFC 8276 user xattrs. |
| `gc_queue` | Orphan stripes scheduled for DS-side cleanup. |
| `delegations` (optional) | Persisted file delegations for cross-MDS visibility. |
| `layouts` (optional) | Persisted layout state for cross-MDS visibility. |
| `coord_*` | Cross-MDS coordination state (subtree ownership, fencing). |
### Atomicity contract
Every mutating MDS op compiles down to **one NDB transaction**.  Examples:
- `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `link`, `rename` use NDB `interpretedUpdateTuple`
  (`incValue` / `subValue`) to update the parent's `nlink`, `mtime`, `ctime`,
  and `change` counter atomically with the dirent insert / delete.  No
  read-modify-write race even when several MDS daemons mutate the same
  parent directory concurrently.
- `setattr` takes an exclusive row lock, reads the current inode, merges
  the requested attribute mask, and writes back in a single transaction.
- `rename` (including the same-cluster cross-subtree case) is one
  transaction in `rondb_shim_rename`: delete src dirent, write dst dirent,
  interpreted parent updates, and child `parent_fileid` change all commit
  atomically.
### Cross-MDS coordination
For a small set of operations that span more than one logical row group
across shards or MDSes, Lattice layers a higher-level protocol on top of the
catalogue:
- `src/cluster/rename_2pc.c` — cross-shard rename when the deployment is
  sharded (the single-RonDB-cluster case collapses into one NDB txn; this
  module exists for multi-cluster topologies).
- `src/cluster/hardlink_2pc.c` — cross-subtree hard link (target inode and
  link directory in different shards).  Disabled by default until the
  surrounding plumbing is complete.
## 7. pNFS layout path
Lattice serves two pNFS layout types:
- **Flex-files** (default) — DS endpoints are NFSv3, one file per stripe.
- **NFSv4.1 file layout** — DS endpoints are NFSv4.1.
Both share the same in-MDS pipeline:
1. **OPEN(create)**.  `op_open` calls `cat_create()`, which allocates a
   fileid, writes the dirent and inode, and (when the pre-allocator is on)
   pulls a stripe coordinate from a per-DS lookahead pool so the layout is
   ready before LAYOUTGET arrives.
2. **LAYOUTGET**.  `op_layoutget` either reuses the pre-grant from OPEN or
   computes placement via `placement_select_ex()` (`src/mds/placement.c`)
   against the active `mds_shard_map` / `ds_health_monitor` view.  The
   resulting stripe map is persisted to the `stripe_maps` table; the layout
   stateid is minted by `layout_state.c` and returned to the client.
   Before granting, a byte-range conflict-recall scan
   (`layout_recall_byte_range_for_holders`) recalls holders whose iomode
   conflicts and whose range overlaps the request.
   `layoutget_newfile_fastpath = true` (default off) skips that scan when
   the target file was created earlier in the SAME compound — a
   brand-new fileid cannot have layout holders, so for the fused
   OPEN(CREATE)+LAYOUTGET pattern the scan is a guaranteed-miss catalogue
   round-trip.  Pre-existing files always keep the full scan.
3. **Client I/O**.  Client opens the DSes named in the layout and reads or
   writes directly.  The MDS sees nothing.
4. **LAYOUTCOMMIT**.  Client tells the MDS the new file size and mtime; the
   MDS updates the inode in one transaction.
5. **LAYOUTRETURN** / **CB_LAYOUTRECALL**.  Either side can drop the layout.
   Recalls are sent on the NFSv4.1 back-channel via `nfs4_cb_layoutrecall`.
The DS pre-allocator (`ds_prealloc.c`) and ds_cache (`ds_cache.c`) exist to
cut the LAYOUTGET fast path to a single in-memory lookup; on cache miss the
fallback is a normal catalogue read.
### Per-DS I/O limits (wire sizing)
Flex-files clients write DIRECTLY to each DS at the sizes the MDS put
in GETDEVICEINFO's `ffdv_rsize`/`ffdv_wsize`, so those fields must
reflect what the DS actually accepts — an oversized constant against a
DS with a smaller `wtmax` wedges hard-mounted clients in a retry loop.
`ds_io_limits.c` probes every ONLINE generic DS with NFSv3 FSINFO on a
configurable cadence (`ds_iolimit_probe_ms`, default 60 s; 0 disables
and restores the legacy 1 MiB constants) and applies a safety policy:
probed `rtmax`/`wtmax` are capped at 1 MiB and rounded down to 4 KiB;
an unprobed DS advertises a 64 KiB fallback; a failed probe keeps
last-known-good; limits below 4 KiB mark the DS ineligible for new
placement (the LAYOUTGET placement fallback filters it out).  Device
IDs carry the DS's limit generation in bytes [8..11], so an effective
change mints a NEW device ID — new layouts force a fresh GETDEVICEINFO
that observes the new sizes — and a DECREASE additionally recalls the
DS's outstanding layouts, strictly after the safe values are
published.  The MDS's own FATTR4_MAXREAD/MAXWRITE advertise
`min(NFS4_PROXY_IO_MAX, weakest probed DS limit)`: the proxy READ/WRITE
path serves at most 64 KiB per op, and the DS term is defence in depth.
Values are process-local by design; nothing is persisted.
### Final-unlink GC
When `op_remove` drops the last link of a regular file
(`compound_namespace.c` → `enqueue_gc_for_final_unlink`), the MDS:
1. Reads the file's stripe map.
2. Enqueues one row in `gc_queue` per unique DS in the map (the worker
   later sweeps stripe/mirror coordinates within each DS).
3. Drops the stripe-map row.
4. Frees any in-memory delegation grants for the now-gone file
   (`deleg_revoke_file`).
The DS GC subsystem (`ds_gc.c`) drains the queue with a coordinator + worker
pool: the coordinator batches rows out of `gc_queue` via
`mds_cat_gc_peek_batch`, hands them to N workers that issue NFS UNLINK to
the DSes, and then deletes the queue row on success.  Transient errors put
the row back in the queue with a back-off; permanent errors flag it and
move on.
## 8. Concurrency and consistency
### State partitioning
- **Catalogue rows** — authoritative.  Concurrent writers are serialised by
  NDB's per-row locking and the single-transaction-per-mutation contract.
- **Per-MDS in-memory state** — hot caches (inode, dirent, ds), open-state
  table, lock table, delegation tables, session table.  Cross-MDS
  visibility for the parts that need it (delegations, sessions, layout
  state) is achieved by also persisting to RonDB; the in-memory copy is a
  fast path keyed by the canonical row.
- **Cross-MDS invalidation** — best-effort, over the cluster transport.
  Caches are tolerant of staleness because every fast-path read validates
  against the catalogue's `change` counter or row generation.
### Any-MDS routing contract
Traffic for any file handle may arrive at ANY MDS, and every MDS must
serve identical state.  Two mechanisms make this hold without relying on
request routing:
- The parent_touch overlay is raise-only: a peer MDS that bumps a
  directory row synchronously can never be masked by a stale deferred
  view on the owning node (`src/mds/parent_touch.c`), so `change_info`
  never regresses and clients cannot pin negative dentries.
- Delete-at-ack corpses are dead on every node: fh-based access to a
  DELETE_PENDING inode returns ESTALE from the shared fh→inode
  resolution (`src/mds/compound.c`), exactly as after a synchronous
  remove.
`referral_strict` (default true) rejects operations on foreign-shard FHs
with `NFS4ERR_MOVED`.  That is topology enforcement plus a locality
optimisation — it is NOT load-bearing for correctness, and no code may
assume a given file's requests reach only its "owning" MDS.
### Locking primitives
- **Striped mutexes.**  Striped `pthread_mutex_t` arrays are the default
  pattern (`open_state`, `delegation`, `lock_state`, `inode_cache`,
  `dirent_cache`, `session`).  Hash on the natural key (clientid, fileid,
  or parent+name) selects the stripe.  Most tables use 16 stripes; the
  open-state table defaults to 1,024 (configurable via
  `open_state_lock_stripes`) because its cardinality tracks live opens.
  The open-state NDB persist runs OUTSIDE the stripe lock: the state is
  published with a persist-pending flag (conflict-visible, immutable,
  operations against it answer NFS4ERR_DELAY), then committed or unwound
  under the relocked stripe.  A failed persist fails the OPEN — in-memory
  state is never published as durable when its row was lost, which the
  any-MDS contract depends on.
- **NDB exclusive row locks.**  Used for `setattr` and a handful of other
  read-modify-write paths that must serialise with concurrent MDSes.
- **Read-mostly hot configs** — `_Atomic` pointers + RCU-style swap on
  reload for the shard map and DS table.  No explicit reader lock.
### Compound-internal snapshot caching
Within a single COMPOUND, an inode is read at most once per fileid.
`compound_inode_get` first checks `cd->current_inode` / `cd->saved_inode`,
then the global `inode_cache`, then the catalogue.  Mutations within the
same compound invalidate via `compound_inode_invalidate`.  This is what
keeps `PUTFH+GETATTR` to a single NDB read.
### Lease and recovery
NFSv4.1 leases are tracked per-client in `session.c`.  Lease expiry runs a
janitor that:
- Calls `deleg_revoke_client` to drop in-memory delegation grants.
- Schedules `open_state_revoke_client` to clean up locks and opens.
- Removes session/connection entries.
Grace mode (`grace.c`) prevents non-reclaim opens during the configured
grace window after daemon start.
## 9. Networking and security
### Front-channel
- ONC-RPC over TCP, NFSv4.1 minor version 1 and 2.
- Auth: AUTH_SYS, AUTH_NULL.  RPCSEC_GSS (krb5/krb5i/krb5p) is gated on the
  `mds_gss` build option.
- TLS: `mds_tls.c` provides per-listener TLS; configurable per export.
- Session sizing: CREATE_SESSION negotiates `ca_maxresponsesize` as
  MIN(client request, `NFS4_REPLY_BUF_SIZE` = 256 KiB — the encode
  buffer a COMPOUND reply is actually built in) and echoes the
  negotiated values in the reply; `ca_maxresponsesize_cached` defaults
  to 64 KiB and never exceeds the response cap.  The reply path
  enforces the cached cap post-encode: a reply that outgrew it is
  answered with `NFS4ERR_REP_TOO_BIG_TO_CACHE` (when `sa_cachethis`
  was set) instead of being slot-cached (RFC 8881 §2.10.6.1.3).
### Back-channel
NFSv4.1 sessions carry an explicit back-channel.  Lattice uses it for:
- `CB_RECALL` of file delegations.
- `CB_LAYOUTRECALL` of pNFS layouts.
- `CB_NOTIFY` for directory delegations (RFC 8881 §10.6).
The back-channel transport is implemented in `nfs4_cb.c` with the same XDR
codec used for the fore-channel.
### Inter-MDS
gRPC over TCP for the cluster transport (`src/cluster/cluster_transport.c`,
`proto/`).  Used for:
- Subtree map / membership change notifications.
- Best-effort cross-MDS cache invalidation.
- The 2PC paths (`rename_2pc`, `hardlink_2pc`) that may live alongside
  multi-cluster deployments.
## 10. Observability
- **Metrics.**  Prometheus text format on a configurable HTTP endpoint
  (`metrics_http.c`).  Counters cover NFS op rates, catalogue txn rates,
  placement decisions, GC backlog, layout error counts, branch-level
  latency histograms.
- **Structured logs.**  Journald via systemd by default; one line per
  significant event (recall, revoke, deadlock-class NDB error, GC error).
- **Optional eBPF tracepoints.**  `src/bpf/` ships a minimal set of USDT
  probes for compound-op latency and catalogue txn timing.
- **Soak harness.**  `scripts/pnfs-lab` drives a multi-host build + deploy +
  smoke + soak workflow against a lab fleet for regression testing.
## 11. Build and test
- **Build.**  CMake-based; `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build`.
  The RonDB backend is gated by `-DHAVE_RONDB=ON` and links against
  `libndbclient`.
- **Unit tests.**  `tests/unit/` against the memdb backend; one binary per
  module.  No external services required.
- **Integration tests.**  `tests/integration/` exercises multi-component
  flows still against memdb.
- **QA gates.**  `scripts/qa-check.sh --quick` runs style, gcc + clang
  builds, cppcheck, clang-tidy, and unit tests.  The full mode adds
  Valgrind and the integration suite.
- **Smoke.**  `scripts/pnfs-smoke.sh` runs a 17-step real-NFS smoke against
  a deployed lab.
- **Soak.**  `tests/soak/pnfs-soak.sh` produces an iter / pass / fail log
  consumed by `pnfs-soak-report.sh` for trend analysis (RSS slope, error
  rate, GC backlog).
## 12. Configuration model
Lattice reads a single INI file (default `/etc/lattice-pnfs/mds.conf`).  Keys are
namespaced by subsystem; the canonical reference is `man lattice-pnfs.conf`
(`docs/man/`).  Important groups:
- `[server]` — listen addresses, worker counts, lease time.
- `[catalogue]` — backend selection, NDB connection string.
- `[cluster]` — MDS id, peer list, subtree map source.
- `[ds]` — DS endpoints, health probe cadence, pre-allocator pool sizes.
- `[gc]` — `ds_gc_workers`, `ds_gc_batch_size`, retry policy.
- `[delegations]` — file and directory delegation toggles, transient mode.
- `[security]` — TLS / GSS settings.
All keys have safe defaults; a minimal config can be a half-dozen lines.
## 13. Limits and known constraints
- One RonDB cluster per Lattice deployment.  Multi-cluster federation is
  out of scope for the core; the 2PC modules exist as building blocks but
  are not exposed as a supported configuration.
- Maximum stripe count and mirror count are fixed at compile time by
  `MDS_MAX_STRIPES` and `MDS_MAX_MIRRORS`.  The defaults are sized for the
  flex-files target.
- Directory delegations are off by default.  Enabling them requires the
  shared-attr backend to be on so recall propagation works across MDSes.
- The hard-link 2PC path is feature-gated and not exercised in production
  deployments.  Cross-subtree LINK returns `NFS4ERR_XDEV` until the
  surrounding work is complete.
## 14. Where to start reading
- **A new COMPOUND op handler.**  `src/mds/compound.c` for dispatch, then
  the topic file (`compound_namespace.c`, `compound_data_io.c`, etc.) and
  one of the existing handlers as a template.  Add the op to the XDR codec
  in `src/common/xdr_codec.c` and the result union in `include/compound.h`.
- **A new catalogue table.**  Add a vtable entry in
  `include/catalogue_internal.h`, implement it for memdb (test path) and
  RonDB shim, expose a typed wrapper in `include/mds_catalogue.h`, and add
  a unit test against memdb.
- **A new background subsystem.**  Mirror `ds_gc.c`: a coordinator + worker
  pool, a stop-pipe + condvar shutdown sequence, INI keys with documented
  defaults in the man page, and a unit test driving the memdb backend.
- **A new pNFS layout type.**  Extend `layout_types.h`, teach
  `compound_layout.c` to mint and return the new layout, and provide a
  device-info encoder in `xdr_codec.c`.
## 15. Metadata search (find-style queries)
NFSv4 has no query verb, so "every file over 1 GiB changed in the last
day" would otherwise be a `LOOKUP`/`READDIR`/`GETATTR` walk costing
millions of RPCs.  Because the catalogue is a single transactional store,
the same question is answerable with one backend table scan.
Three layers, each read-only:
- **Scan primitives.**  `rondb_shim_inode_scan` and
  `rondb_shim_dirent_scan_name` in `catalogue_rondb_shim.cpp` issue a
  single `LM_CommittedRead` scan across all fragments in parallel.
  Attribute predicates (type, size, uid, gid, mtime, ctime) are pushed
  into an `NdbScanFilter`, so non-matching rows are discarded on the data
  nodes.  No locks are taken, so a search cannot block a mutation.
  `catalogue_rondb_inode_scan` / `catalogue_rondb_dirent_scan_name` are
  the catalogue-handle wrappers, returning `MDS_ERR_NOSUPPORT` for
  backends that cannot scan.
- **Query core.**  `src/tools/find_query.c` owns predicate parsing and
  strategy selection: an exact fileid becomes one keyed read; a name-only
  search scans dirents (where the name already lives) and fills
  attributes with one keyed read per match; anything with attribute
  predicates scans inodes and resolves names afterwards.  Name matching
  is always finished locally with `fnmatch(3)`; the backend LIKE filter is
  built as a deliberate superset and is a bandwidth optimisation only, so
  it can never change which entries match.
- **Interfaces.**  `mds-find` (CLI, backend-local), `mds-apid` (read-only
  HTTP/JSON service with bearer auth and optional TLS/mTLS), and
  `scripts/lattice-find` (client-side wrapper for hosts with no backend
  access and no NFS mount).
Two properties operators must understand.  First, the `mds-apid` token is
an **administrative** credential: it enumerates the whole namespace
regardless of POSIX traversal permissions, so it is not equivalent to what
`find` would show a given user.  Second, predicate pushdown reduces wire
traffic but not rows scanned, so every query costs a full fragment scan
and competes with the NFS hot path for backend CPU.  Operator-facing
detail is in `find-api.md`.
## 16. HPC-Shared file mode (N-to-1 wide stripe)
Lattice ships an opt-in per-inode mode for the N-to-1 HPC workload
pattern (many compute clients writing into the same file at
distinct byte ranges).  When the `MDS_IFLAG_HPC_SHARED` bit is set,
LAYOUTGET emits a wide stripe geometry, prefers RDMA / GPUDirect DSes
for placement, and (in deferred phases) bypasses the per-client
layout grant and aggregates LAYOUTCOMMITs.
Files without the bit set continue to use the legacy paths
bit-for-bit unchanged.  Operator-facing surface — triggers, tunables,
deferred phases, caveats — is in `hpc-shared-files.md`.  The full
phase plan and design rationale is in `hpc-nto1-plan.md`.
