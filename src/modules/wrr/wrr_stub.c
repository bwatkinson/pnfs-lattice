 * wrr_stub.c — no-op stub for WRR + capacity placement kernels.

 * Linked into pnfs_mds_core when ENABLE_WRR=OFF (community build).
 *
 * Semantics: both pickers return 0 (the first online slot).  The
 * surrounding walk-forward logic in placement_select_ex() then
 * advances to the next free slot when 0 is already taken, which
 * gives an RR-equivalent placement across stripes.  WEIGHTED_RR
 * and CAPACITY policies therefore degrade gracefully to plain RR
 * on community builds — operators that explicitly request a
 * weighted policy still get a valid placement, just not weighted.
