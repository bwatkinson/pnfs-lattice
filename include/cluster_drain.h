 * @brief Drain all subtrees from the local node.
 *
 * Transitions self from ACTIVE_SERVING → DRAINING, migrates each
 * owned subtree to @p dest_mds_id, verifies zero remaining, and
 * transitions to NODE_DRAINED.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   - Must be called on the donor node (self_id must match).
 *   - Rejects if self owns root subtree "/" (out of scope).
 *   - Non-transactional: completed migrations are not rolled back
 *     on partial failure.  On failure, lifecycle returns to
 *     ACTIVE_SERVING with potentially fewer subtrees.
 *
 * @param ctx         Membership handle.
 * @param map         Subtree map handle.
 * @param cat         Local catalogue handle.
 * @param dest_mds_id Destination MDS for all subtrees.
 * @return MDS_OK on full drain, MDS_ERR_PERM if preconditions fail,
 *         MDS_ERR_IO / other on migration failure (partial drain).
