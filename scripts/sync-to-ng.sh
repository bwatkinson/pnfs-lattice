# sync-to-ng.sh — Mirror main to PEAK-AIO/pnfs-ng with Warp artefacts stripped.
#
# pmds (this repo) tracks some files that must never land in the
# public pnfs-ng mirror:
#
#   .warp/                 — Warp agent working directory
#   AGENTS.md              — project rules for the Warp agent
#   scripts/sync-to-ng.sh  — this script (pnfs-ng has no use for it)
#   scripts/git-hooks/     — the ng-specific pre-push guardrail
#
# The script:
#   1. Clones the current main branch into a scratch directory.
#   2. Rewrites history with git-filter-repo, removing every path in
#      the strip list above from every commit.
#   3. Force-pushes the rewritten main to the pnfs-ng remote.
#
# The scratch directory is deleted on exit via trap.  Nothing is
# written back to the working clone.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sync-to-ng.sh            # sync current HEAD of main
#   NG_URL=... scripts/sync-to-ng.sh # override the target remote
#
# Requires: git-filter-repo (pipx install git-filter-repo or apt
# install git-filter-repo), git, mktemp.
