# pNFS quick smoke — one test per op.
#
# Design notes:
#   * Preconditions (mount-is-nfs4, mount is actually mounted) run
#     FIRST and fail the whole script with exit 2 before any data-path
#     test runs.  The old layout put that check at the end, which
#     meant 12 of 13 tests would "pass" against a local directory if
#     the NFS mount had silently dropped.
#   * Content tests compute an expected md5 BEFORE touching the
#     server and compare the server-side md5 against it.  The old
#     "compute md5, drop caches, compute md5 again, compare" path
#     passed on two empty files (md5 of empty == md5 of empty) — the
#     exact failure mode that hid the recent pNFS write regression.
#   * Read-back after close catches LAYOUTCOMMIT failures: a broken
#     LAYOUTCOMMIT reports success to the client but leaves MDS size
#     at zero, so the next read returns nothing even though the
#     write()/close() returned 0.
