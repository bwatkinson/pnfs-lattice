All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Find-style metadata search: `mds-find`, `mds-apid`, and
  `lattice-find`** — NFSv4 has no query verb, so answering "every file
  over 1 GiB changed in the last day" meant a `LOOKUP`/`READDIR`/
  `GETATTR` walk costing millions of RPCs and saturating the metadata
  server.  The catalogue is a single transactional store, so the same
  question is now answered by one backend table scan.  Two read-only scan
  primitives (`rondb_shim_inode_scan`, `rondb_shim_dirent_scan_name`)
  push type/size/uid/gid/mtime/ctime predicates into an `NdbScanFilter`,
  so non-matching rows are discarded on the data nodes and never cross
  the wire; both use committed-read semantics and take no row locks, so a
  search cannot block a mutation.  On top of them: `mds-find`, a CLI with
  find(1) predicate syntax; `mds-apid`, a read-only HTTP/JSON service
  exposing `GET /api/v1/find` behind a constant-time-compared bearer
  token with optional native TLS and mTLS; and `scripts/lattice-find`, a
  client-side wrapper giving the same syntax to hosts that can reach
  neither the metadata backend nor an NFS mount.  No schema change and no
  new tables.
  Two behaviours operators must know: the `mds-apid` token is an
  **administrative** credential that enumerates the whole namespace
  regardless of POSIX traversal permissions (per-token UID scoping is
  deferred), and predicate pushdown cuts wire traffic but not rows
  scanned, so every query is a full fragment scan competing with the NFS
  hot path for backend CPU.  `mds-apid` refuses a non-loopback cleartext
  bind and a token file readable beyond its owner.  Name matching is
  exact `fnmatch(3)`; the backend LIKE filter is a deliberately
  constructed superset used only to cut bandwidth, so it can never change
  which entries match.  See `docs/find-api.md`.

### Changed
- **LAYOUTGET skips per-stripe DS round-trips for wide files created
  in the same compound** — the fused OPEN(CREATE)+LAYOUTGET path paid
  three per-stripe DS costs that verify or align state the wide
  pre-warm had itself produced milliseconds earlier in the same
  compound: the verify-on-serve re-probe of every stripe's backing
  file (`layout_refresh_wide_stripe_fhs`, ~18.5 ms of LAYOUTGET DS
  I/O per 4-stripe create), the ffl_user/ffl_group ownership chown of
  every stripe's backing file (~5 ms per create — the files were just
  created 0666 by the pre-warm, so DS access never hinged on it), and
  the guaranteed-miss byte-range conflict-recall holder scan (a fresh
  fileid cannot have layout holders; the single-stripe create path
  already skipped it).  op_open now records the wide-created fileid
  in the compound context and op_layoutget skips all three for that
  fileid, gated on the existing `layoutget_newfile_fastpath`
  same-compound-trust knob.  Re-serves of pre-existing files (reopen
  after cache eviction, DS wipe recovery) keep the full
  verify-on-serve, ownership-alignment, and recall-scan behaviour.
- **Wide-create DS file-handle capture is now parallel** — the HPC
  wide pre-warm (`ds_prealloc_batch`, both the community synchronous
  implementation and the enterprise ring engine's batch path) used to
  create + FH-capture the stripe_count × mirror_count DS backing
  files one at a time, putting one NFS round-trip per stripe on the
  OPEN(CREATE) critical path; mdtest-style create bursts in a
  4-stripe HPC-Shared directory ran at ~28% of the non-HPC create
  rate.  A new `mds_proxy_ensure_ds_file_fh_batch` helper captures
  the slots with a bounded fork-join (up to 8 workers including the
  calling thread, slot indices from an atomic cursor, each worker
  writing only its own disjoint entry, all joined before return).
  Per-slot semantics are unchanged: failed slots keep an empty FH,
  the enterprise synthetic-FH fallback still applies per slot, and
  the all-or-nothing rollback (GC-enqueue of captured slots with the
  geometry sweep hint) is preserved.  Thread spawn failure degrades
  to capturing the remaining slots on the calling thread.

### Fixed
- **GCC 15 rejected `compound_layout.c` under the project's C11
  `-Werror` build** — `fill_layoutget_result` was a label immediately
  followed by a declaration; comments do not make that valid C11, and
  GCC 15 diagnoses it as `-Wfree-labels`.  The label now has an
  explicit null statement, with no control-flow or layout behavior
  change.
- **Layout-cache insertion could read beyond the caller's entries
  array for an invalid geometry** — `layout_cache_put` previously
  checked only that stripe and mirror counts were nonzero before
  copying `stripe_count * mirror_count` entries.  It now rejects
  dimensions above `MDS_MAX_STRIPES` or `MDS_MAX_MIRRORS`, the same
  compile-time limits used throughout the MDS, before allocating or
  reading the caller buffer.
- **Explicit layout-cache clears were reported as capacity
  evictions** — `layout_cache_clear` used the LRU capacity-eviction
  helper, inflating `evictions` and leaving `invalidations` unchanged.
  It now frees each cache entry through the ordinary removal path and
  increments `invalidations`, so the counters distinguish operator or
  test clears from cache pressure.
- **REMOVE of a wide (multi-stripe) file leaked every DS backing
  file** — the ds_gc drainer's slot probe assumed a file's stripes
  are dense from 0 on each DS and stopped at the first absent one.
  With round-robin placement a wide file holds only its own stripe
  indices per DS (stripe k on DS k), so the probe of stripe 0 missed,
  the queue row was dequeued as done, and every non-stripe-0 backing
  file leaked (observed: ~150k orphaned files / ~20 GB per DS after
  an io500 run's deletes, with `pnfs_mds_gc_pending` at 0).  GC queue
  rows now carry a `sweep_hint` column (nullable dynamic Unsigned,
  added by an idempotent online ALTER; NULL/0 = legacy dense sweep so
  pre-hint rows and rolling upgrades behave exactly as before):
  `MDS_GC_SWEEP_GEOM(sc, mc)` makes the drainer probe every
  (stripe, mirror) slot of the file's real geometry, and
  `MDS_GC_SWEEP_SLOT(s, m)` reclaims exactly one slot for the
  rebalance mover (whose moved-away file was equally leaked whenever
  its stripe index was non-zero — and whose file's other live slots a
  whole-file sweep must not touch).  Every geometry-aware enqueue
  site now stamps the hint: op_remove (split and fused REMOVE+GC
  paths), rename-overwrite, orphan finalize, the async-REMOVE
  manifest drainer, HPC wide-create rollback, ds_prealloc batch
  rollback (both builds), cross-shard rename overwrite, and the
  rebalance mover.
- **HPC-Shared CREATE failed with `NFS4ERR_INVAL` in the community
  build** — the default build (`ENABLE_DS_PREALLOC=OFF`) linked a
  `ds_prealloc_batch` stub that returned a permanent `MDS_ERR_INVAL`
  on the assumption that community deployments could never mark an
  inode HPC-Shared.  The `user.pnfs.hpc_shared` control xattr has no
  build gate, so flagging a directory made every file create inside
  it fail with `EINVAL` on all clients.  The stub now implements the
  wide pre-warm batch synchronously (fileid-rotated round-robin
  placement plus per-stripe DS file creation and FH capture, same
  all-or-nothing rollback contract as the enterprise ring pipeline),
  so HPC-Shared N-to-1 directories work in the community build.  The
  wide-create path additionally logs a WARN with the failing step and
  geometry when a pre-warm or catalogue commit fails — previously the
  OPEN surfaced a bare error with nothing in the daemon log.

### Added
- **Native `mds-admin` controls for HPC-Shared mode** — authorized
  operators can now run `hpc enable <path>`, `hpc disable <path>`, and
  `hpc status <path> [--json]` against the daemon's cluster-transport
  port.  The commands update or report only the existing
  `MDS_IFLAG_HPC_SHARED` inode bit through the catalogue; they do not
  introduce a new placement policy or re-stripe existing files.  A
  directory transition affects the established inheritance path for
  future children only.  Successful transitions invalidate the local
  inode and HPC layout-cache entries, and malformed paths or pending
  wide creates are rejected before mutation.
- **NFSv4.1 conformance findings document** —
  `docs/conformance-nfs41-findings.md` records the pynfs + NFStest
  campaign results after the first fix round: 198/198 on the pynfs
  `all` set with delegations enabled, 459/461 on nfstest_posix, the
  three defects fixed in PR #90, the items resolved without code
  change (full-DS root cause of the "blocking-lock hang"; pynfs
  harness artifacts), and the prioritised open defect queue
  (capacity-aware placement deferred to the enterprise tier,
  DSESS9003 callback retransmit, mtime/atime propagation, COPY
  re-enable, orphan sweeper, CB_NOTIFY_LOCK).  Documentation only —
  no behaviour changes.
- **Wave 7 mutation-path design document** —
  `docs/perf-wave7-mutation-design.md` records the mutation-rate
  design study: the decomposition plan for the ~0.78 ms fused-create
  commit; the as-built async batch pipeline's semantics (per-caller
  blocking, NFSv4-invisible) and its previously undocumented
  `Ndb::init()` default cap of 4 concurrent transactions per
  connection; the evidence that file delegations are disabled as a
  measured performance trade rather than for correctness, and that
  NFSv4.1 offers no write-back namespace mutation (directory
  delegations relieve ancillary traffic only); the crash-consistency
  budget of each deferred-durability knob, including the open parent
  change-attribute monotonicity question for `parent_touch_deferred`;
  and the cross-MDS serialisation inventory.  Design only — no
  behaviour, config-default, or test changes.
- **Wave-6 decision instrumentation** — the profile-gated wave 6 items
  are closed as "decision pending lab numbers" (see
  `docs/perf-wave6-findings.md` for every disposition), and the three
  items whose deciding numbers could not previously be produced are
  now measurable from `/metrics` deltas:
  `pnfs_mds_cat_transient_retries` / `_backoff_us` /
  `_retry_exhausted` (RonDB wrapper transient-retry pressure, T6.3);
  `pnfs_mds_ds_fh_cache_hits` / `_misses` (DS filehandle-capture
  cache hit ratio, T6.4); and a `cat_op="unlink_recall"` latency
  histogram timing the client-visible final-unlink layout recall so
  all four REMOVE-path cost classes are separable (T6.5).  No
  request-path behaviour changes; relaxed-atomic counters and one
  timed scope on an existing call.
- **Per-DS I/O limit prober (Wave 5)** — new `ds_io_limits` module +
  `ds_iolimit_probe_ms` config key (default 60000; 0 disables).  Each
  ONLINE generic DS is probed with NFSv3 FSINFO for its real
  `rtmax`/`wtmax`; the effective values (capped 1 MiB, rounded down to
  4 KiB, 64 KiB unverified fallback, last-known-good on probe failure)
  feed GETDEVICEINFO's per-DS `ffdv_rsize`/`ffdv_wsize`.  Limits below
  4 KiB mark the DS ineligible for new layout placement.  Any
  effective change bumps the DS's device-ID generation (bytes [8..11]
  of the device ID) so clients re-fetch device info; a DECREASE
  additionally recalls the DS's outstanding layouts — after the safe
  values are published, never before.  New metrics:
  `pnfs_mds_ds_iolimit_probe_failures`,
  `pnfs_mds_ds_iolimit_capability_recalls` (counters) and
  `pnfs_mds_ds_iolimit_min_read`/`_write` (gauges).
- **Protocol state-table sizing keys (Wave 4)** —
  `open_state_file_buckets`, `open_state_stateid_buckets`,
  `open_state_lock_stripes`, `session_client_buckets`,
  `session_session_buckets`, `session_owner_buckets`.  The open-state
  tables move from compile-time 256+256 buckets / 16 stripes to
  1,048,576 buckets per hash / 1,024 stripes by default, and the
  session tables from 256 to 65,536 buckets; the keys tune them down
  on constrained hosts.  Effective open-state sizing is logged at
  startup so chain depth can be correlated with measurements.  The
  session stripe-lock count stays fixed at 16 by design (lock-all
  destroy protocol).  Per-open allocation now comes from per-stripe
  64-entry chunk pools recycled under the already-held stripe mutex
  instead of a calloc/free per OPEN/CLOSE.
- **`layoutget_newfile_fastpath` config key (Wave 3)** — when enabled
  (default off), `op_layoutget` skips the byte-range conflict-recall
  holder scan for a file created earlier in the SAME compound (fused
  OPEN(CREATE)+LAYOUTGET): a fileid that did not exist before the
  request cannot have layout holders, so the scan is a guaranteed-miss
  catalogue round-trip on the create hot path.  Pre-existing files
  keep the full scan + byte-range recall behaviour regardless of the
  switch (regression-tested: a conflicting LAYOUTGET from a second
  client on an existing file still triggers the recall with the
  fastpath enabled).  Skipped scans are counted by the new
  `pnfs_mds_layoutget_newfile_scan_skipped` metric.
- **Build hygiene knobs** — `ENABLE_RELEASE_ASSERTS` (default ON keeps
  the historical `-UNDEBUG`; OFF makes the assertion cost measurable),
  `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` defaults to Release when unset (a bare cmake
  invocation can no longer produce a silent -O0 tree), and opt-in
  `ENABLE_LTO` / `ENABLE_NATIVE_ARCH` codegen knobs (both OFF).
- **mk/rm scale benchmark** — `bench_mk_rm_scale` (tests/integration)
  measures create, synchronous-remove, and delete-at-ack (ack-path)
  throughput at 1/4/8/16 threads in shared-directory vs
  directory-per-thread modes, directly exposing the parent-row
  serialisation wall at the catalogue API level.  Runs against memdb
  (CI smoke) or a live RonDB cluster (`--rondb CONF`).
- **`scripts/mds-metrics-diff`** — read-only helper that snapshots the
  Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint before/after a workload burst and
  prints the largest counter and histogram `_sum`/`_count` deltas;
  the fastest way to attribute burst milliseconds to a code region.
- **`rpc_listener_threads` config key** — makes the TCP RPC listener
  (SO_REUSEPORT epoll loop) count operator-tunable (range 0..32).
  `0` (the default) keeps the historical auto rule
  `min(worker_threads, 4)`; explicit values are clamped to online
  CPUs and to the compile-time maximum (32).  At `nconnect=8/16` four
  listeners can be the binding constraint before worker count.
  Rendered by `mds-admin config show`.
- **Async NDB write pipeline (Phase 4)** — setting
  `ndb_async_writes = true` now routes single-commit creates
  (`ns_create` and the fused create+layout) through the
  per-connection async batch pipeline (`executeAsynchPrepare` +
  `sendPreparedTransactions` + `pollNdb` driven by a flush thread),
  so concurrent worker threads share NDB send/poll cycles instead of
  serializing one `execute(Commit)` round trip each.  Per-request
  semantics are unchanged: each caller still blocks until its own
  transaction commits, and error mapping (EXISTS / retryable /
  permanent) is identical to the synchronous path.

### Changed
- **Truthful wire size advertisement (Wave 5)** — FATTR4_MAXREAD /
  FATTR4_MAXWRITE now emit `min(64 KiB proxy per-op ceiling, weakest
  probed DS limit)` instead of a hardcoded 1 MiB the MDS proxy path
  always short-served (its READ/WRITE scratch is 64 KiB per op; pNFS
  data-path sizing is unaffected — flex-files clients take per-DS
  limits from GETDEVICEINFO).  CREATE_SESSION now negotiates
  `ca_maxresponsesize` against the real 256 KiB reply buffer and
  echoes the negotiated response/cached caps in the reply (previously:
  accepted up to 1 MiB, then emitted hardcoded 1 MiB / 64 KiB
  regardless); the cached cap never exceeds the response cap.  The
  GETDEVICEINFO result union arm shrank from 16 DS rows to 2 (a device
  ID resolves to exactly one DS), cutting ~11 KB per result slot.
- **OPEN-state persistence runs outside the stripe lock (Wave 4)** —
  `open_state_open()` used to execute its synchronous NDB write while
  holding the per-file stripe mutex, serialising every OPEN/CLOSE on
  the stripe — and every other open owner on the same file — behind a
  network round-trip.  The state is now published with a
  persist-pending flag, the round-trip runs with no open-state locks
  held, and the stripe is relocked to commit or unwind.  Pending
  states are visible to share-reservation conflict checks immediately
  but immutable until durable: a same-owner re-OPEN, CLOSE, or
  OPEN_DOWNGRADE during the window answers NFS4ERR_DELAY (the client
  cannot legitimately hold the stateid yet — the OPEN reply is not
  sent until the persist completes).  Same-file OPEN concurrency
  measurements are a lab follow-up per the wave's exit criteria.
- **Striped inode cache (Wave 3)** — the global inode LRU is now
  partitioned into 16 independent stripes (per-stripe hash table, LRU
  list, mutex, and capacity `ceil(inode_cache_size / 16)`), mirroring
  the dirent cache.  The previous implementation serialized every
  lookup on one global mutex and wrote a shared LRU list on every hit,
  making the cache itself a contention point on GETATTR-heavy
  multi-worker workloads.  Write-through, invalidation, and
  positive-TTL semantics are unchanged; eviction is now stripe-local
  (a skewed fileid distribution can evict from a full stripe while
  another has room — same trade-off as the dirent and layout caches).
- **Wave-2 heap scratch**: the compound op/result unions no longer
  inline worst-case payloads.  READ, READ_PLUS, GETXATTR, LISTXATTRS
  and the READDIR page arrays (results), plus WRITE, WRITE_SAME and
  SETXATTR bytes (op arguments), live in per-slot scratch blocks
  OUTSIDE the unions, allocated grow-once at the protocol maximum and
  reused for the worker's lifetime.  `sizeof(struct nfs4_result)`
  drops 524,496 -> 12,928 B and `sizeof(struct nfs4_op)` 65,808 ->
  4,416 B; static per-worker slot scratch falls ~37.8 MB -> ~1.11 MB.
- The per-op full-union memset in `compound_process` (524 KB per op,
  ~2.6 MB cleared per five-op compound) is replaced by
  `nfs4_result_reset()`, which zeroes only the incoming op's union arm
  and nothing at all for status-only ops.  `nfs4_result_destroy()`
  still runs first, and the fresh-thread zero-init guarantee is
  preserved (both thread-local slot arrays are calloc'd).
- `compound_init()` clears ~1.7 KB instead of ~9.8 KB per request: the
  two 4 KB path buffers moved to the struct tail (layout pinned by
  `_Static_assert`s) and are emptied by a single NUL byte each.
- The stripe-entry serialisation buffers in `stripe_map_get` and the
  fused LAYOUTGET (~136 KiB / ~544 KiB worst case) now come from a
  grow-once thread-local scratch instead of a per-call `malloc`/`free`.
  Both sizes exceeded glibc's 128 KiB mmap threshold, so every call
  previously paid an mmap + page-fault + munmap cycle on the LAYOUTGET
  hot path.  Buffers are released at thread exit via a pthread key
  destructor.
- CREATE placement is now pop-once on the live path: the pre-create
  `ds_prealloc_peek` was removed and every per-compound stripe-cache
  fill derives from the entry the fused create actually popped
  (including its stripe unit, surfaced via a new out-parameter).  The
  peek remains only in the commit-queue pregrant branch, which is
  test-only under the RonDB daemon (`cq` is pinned NULL) and documented
  as such.  Saves one prealloc ring-mutex acquisition per CREATE and
  removes the last two-source placement pattern.
- Logging level checks moved from inside `mds_log()` into the
  `MDS_LOG_*` macros: a suppressed DEBUG/TRACE call site now costs one
  relaxed atomic load and a predicted branch instead of a varargs
  function call.  Runtime level changes via `mds_log_set_level()`
  remain thread-safe (atomic stores paired with the macro loads).
- The RPC threadpool's queue-wait sampling (two `clock_gettime` calls
  per work item plus a histogram observation) is now gated on the
  existing `metrics_op_enabled` switch; with op metrics disabled the
  dispatch path performs no clock reads.  The plain dispatcher
  counters (submitted/completed/queue-full totals, active workers,
  queue depth) stay always-on.
- Per-connection NDB flush threads are now created lazily, only when
  `ndb_async_writes = true` is set at startup.  With the flag off
  (the default) no flush threads exist, removing the idle
  send/poll cycle that previously ran every 10 ms per connection.
  Armed flush threads also skip NDB API calls entirely while no
  transaction is in flight.

### Fixed
- **Server-side COPY / CLONE re-enabled** — `op_copy` / `op_clone` no
  longer return NFS4ERR_NOTSUPP.  The historical "silent data loss on
  small copies" was root-caused to four stacked defects, all fixed:
  (1) `decode_op_copy` / `decode_op_copy_notify` never consumed the
  trailing `netloc4` fields (`ca_source_server<>` /
  `cna_destination_server`), desyncing the XDR stream so every op
  after COPY decoded as garbage and the client failed the compound
  with EREMOTEIO; (2) an async COPY request was accepted and answered
  with a callback stateid although CB_OFFLOAD is not implemented, so
  copy_file_range() blocked forever — the server now always completes
  synchronously (explicitly allowed by RFC 7862 §15.2.3);
  (3) the COPY reply carried an all-zero `wr_writeverf` while the
  bundled COMMIT returned the boot-epoch verifier — the Linux client
  treats the mismatch as a server reboot and retried the copy in a
  ~600/s storm; the reply now carries the same verifier as COMMIT
  (byte-matched to the encoder);
  (4) the proxy's chunk writes land in this host's NFS page cache for
  the destination DS mounts, so a client reading the destination
  DS-direct immediately after the FILE_SYNC4 reply raced the
  writeback and saw a zero-filled file — the original "size=19,
  content=''" symptom.  `mds_proxy_copy_data` now fsyncs the
  destination's DS backing files (new `mds_proxy_flush_file`) before
  returning.  COPY with `ca_count == 0` now implements the RFC 7862
  copy-to-EOF semantics (pynfs COPY5).
  Validated on the lab: copy_file_range md5-verified at 19 B / 4 KiB /
  1 MiB / 20 MiB with exactly one COPY op each; `cp` (CLONE path)
  verified; pynfs `copy` flag passes; `all` regression unchanged.
- **Unanswered CB_RECALLs were never retransmitted over a replacement
  session (pynfs DSESS9003)** — conflict-recalls revoke the grant and
  send CB_RECALL once, best-effort; a client that destroyed the
  session the callback was sent over never heard about the recall
  again.  Every recall is now recorded in a pending-recall ledger
  (cleared by DELEGRETURN, FREE_STATEID, or client destroy;
  TTL-reaped after one lease period with a resend cap — the
  backchannel is fire-and-forget, so a successful send is not an
  acknowledgment).  CREATE_SESSION for a client with ledgered
  recalls schedules
  a short-lived detached worker that retransmits them over the newly
  bound backchannel — deferred briefly because a callback referencing
  the new session before the client processes the CREATE_SESSION
  reply would be rejected with NFS4ERR_BADSESSION.
- **CLOSE after rename-over-an-open-file returned NFS4ERR_STALE
  (pynfs RNM21)** — overwriting the last link of an OPEN regular file
  via RENAME deleted its inode row inside the rename transaction, so
  the holder's subsequent PUTFH+CLOSE failed with STALE.  The rename
  path now implements POSIX unlink-of-open semantics: with live local
  opens on the target, the new `MDS_CAT_RNF_KEEP_DST_ORPHAN` rename
  keeps the row (nlink 0 + new `MDS_IFLAG_UNLINK_ORPHAN` flag) in the
  same transaction, and the LAST CLOSE finalizes the orphan — GC of
  DS objects, stripe rows, inode row, quota
  (`compound_orphan_finalize`).  Orphan inodes keep resolving through
  PUTFH (unlike `DELETE_PENDING` corpses, which stay deliberately
  dead).  Known limitation: opens are tracked per-MDS in memory, so a
  cross-MDS open or a crash between the rename and the last CLOSE
  leaves the orphan row for a future sweeper — same blind spot as the
  async-remove writer gate.
- **Rename-overwrite leaked the overwritten file's DS objects** —
  unlike REMOVE, the rename-overwrite path performed no layout
  recall, no GC enqueue, no stripe-row cleanup and no quota release
  for the destroyed file; its DS data files leaked on every
  overwrite.  op_rename now mirrors op_remove's final-unlink
  sequence: layouts are revoked before the mutation (same
  STALE-PUTFH/CB_LAYOUTRECALL deadlock rationale), delegations are
  dropped, and on the delete path the DS objects are GC'd, orphaned
  stripe rows removed and quota adjusted.
- **DESTROY_SESSION accepted from unbound connections (pynfs
  DSESS9001)** — sessions now track their fore-channel connection
  bindings (RFC 8881 §2.10.3.1): the CREATE_SESSION connection binds
  at session creation and every accepted SEQUENCE implicitly binds
  its carrying connection, inside the same shard critical section the
  sequence check already holds (no extra hot-path locking).
  DESTROY_SESSION from a connection that is not bound to the target
  session now fails with NFS4ERR_CONN_NOT_BOUND_TO_SESSION instead of
  destroying the session; one SEQUENCE over that connection makes a
  retry legal.  Connection teardown clears fore-channel bindings
  alongside the existing backchannel unbind (now under the lock-all
  protocol so teardown cannot race shard-locked binding writes).
- **EXCHANGE_ID state-protection decode desync (pynfs EID50)** — the
  argument decoder read the `state_protect4_a` discriminant but never
  consumed the SP4_MACH_CRED / SP4_SSV union arms, so an SSV
  EXCHANGE_ID left the arm bytes in the XDR stream and every
  subsequent field/op decoded as garbage (surfacing as
  NFS4ERR_BADXDR on whatever the client sent next).  The decoder now
  consumes both arms with bounded skips and records the discriminant;
  `op_exchange_id` rejects SP4_SSV up front with the SSV-specific
  NFS4ERR_ENCR_ALG_UNSUPP (matching Linux knfsd — the SSV GSS
  mechanism remains unimplemented), and SP4_MACH_CRED degrades to
  SP4_NONE semantics on this AUTH_SYS-only server (the reply always
  advertises SP4_NONE).  New decode regression tests cover both arms
  with a trailing sentinel op that only parses when the stream stays
  in sync.
- **Test-suite debt retired: zero known failures** — every
  long-carried known test failure was test-side; `ctest` now passes
  60/60 with no exceptions and no product code changed.  Twenty
  unit-test runners counted a test as passed even when its assertions
  failed (the defect previously fixed in test_config/test_compound);
  they now record failures and exit non-zero, which had been hiding
  five stale test_xdr_codec assertions (minimal-bitmap trimming,
  SEQUENCE argument/result field order per RFC 8881 §18.46, and
  GET_DIR_DELEGATION's NFS4_OK + `gddrnf_status` wire shape).  Nine
  test_compound LAYOUTGET tests now opt in to the `serve_layouts`
  master switch they predated (they failed with LAYOUTUNAVAILABLE
  instead of their DELAY/TOOSMALL contracts); the referral tests
  expect the subtree-path rootpath (the old hardcoded "/" aliased
  every referral submount to the owner's root); and
  test_layout_recall's assertions match the documented grant-time
  revoke and no-CB-on-unlink recall contracts.
- **Corrupted `/metrics` output window (Wave 6)** — the v2 Prometheus
  render advanced its output offset TWICE after the OPEN-create
  phase block (a stray duplicate guard), leaving an ~1.6 KB window of
  unrendered bytes in the middle of every scrape and over-reporting
  the rendered length.  The full v2 render path is now exercised by
  the unit suite, which had never called it.
- **GETDEVICEINFO advertised I/O sizes the DS may reject (Wave 5)** —
  the flex-files `ffdv_rsize`/`ffdv_wsize` fields were hardcoded to
  1 MiB.  Clients write DIRECTLY to the DS at the advertised size, so
  against a data server with a smaller `wtmax` (e.g. a stock 512 KiB
  knfsd export) every large WRITE was rejected and hard-mounted
  clients wedged in an unkillable retry loop.  The fields now carry
  the DS's probed limits (see the Wave 5 prober under Added); with
  probing disabled the legacy constants are preserved bit-for-bit.
- **Oversized replies were slot-cached despite the negotiated cap
  (Wave 5)** — RFC 8881 §2.10.6.1.3 requires a reply larger than
  `ca_maxresponsesize_cached` NOT be cached and, when the client set
  `sa_cachethis`, be answered with `NFS4ERR_REP_TOO_BIG_TO_CACHE`.
  The reply path now enforces the cap post-encode against the real
  reply bytes; `sa_cachethis=false` replies keep the historical
  cache-always behaviour (RFC-permitted) so legal replays keep
  working.  Regression-tested over a loopback wire flow.
- **Silently ignored OPEN-state persist failures (Wave 4)** — both
  `mds_coord_open_put()` call sites discarded the return value, so a
  failed NDB write published in-memory open state as though durable:
  peer MDSes missed the share reservation (any-MDS contract
  violation) and a restart forgot the open.  Policy is now
  fail-the-OPEN: the in-memory mutation is fully unwound (fresh open
  removed, upgrade's seqid/share bits restored) and the client gets
  NFS4ERR_DELAY to retry once NDB heals.  `MDS_ERR_NOSUPPORT`
  (backend without a shared open-state table) keeps the historical
  nothing-to-persist contract.  Regression-tested with an injected
  persist failure.
- The fused CREATE+layout path now persists the popped prealloc
  entry's configured stripe unit in the durable stripe-map header.  It
  previously hardcoded 65536 (despite a comment claiming otherwise), a
  latent geometry mismatch whenever `stripe_unit_bytes` was configured
  differently (e.g. 1 MiB lab profiles).
- README and configuration docs no longer overstate the cache
  subsystem: the inode cache was (at the time of this fix) a global
  LRU under a single mutex — since striped 16-way, see Changed — and
  both the inode and dirent caches default to disabled
  (`inode_cache_size = 0`, `dirent_cache_size = 0`).  The stale
  16384/32768 defaults in `docs/config-keys.md` and `mds.conf(5)`
  were corrected to match the code.
- `test_config` now actually fails when an assertion fails: the
  runner previously counted every test as passed because assertion
  macros only printed and returned.  This had been masking a stale
  assertion that still expected the old 32768 dirent-cache default;
  the assertion was updated to the shipped default (0, disabled).

## [v0.1.1-community] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **`showmount -e` compatibility responder** — a tiny ONC-RPC listener
  on UDP and TCP (default port `20048`) that answers program `100005`
  (mountd) v3 procedures `NULL`, `EXPORT`, and `DUMP` with a
  synthetic, MDS-defined export list. Every other procedure —
  including `MNT` — is rejected with `PROC_UNAVAIL` at the RPC layer,
  so the MDS still cannot be NFSv3-mounted through this shim. No DS
  interaction; the export strings are operator-controlled. See
  `docs/mountd-compat.md` for the full design and threat model.
- New `mds.conf` keys (all optional):
  `mountd_compat_enabled`, `mountd_compat_port`,
  `mountd_compat_bind_addr`, `mountd_compat_register_rpcbind`,
  `mountd_compat_exports`.

### Changed (upgrade behaviour)
- The shim is **enabled by default**. On first restart after upgrade,
  the daemon will additionally:
  - Bind UDP and TCP on `0.0.0.0:20048` (IANA mountd port).
  - Register `100005/3` with the local rpcbind via `PMAPPROC_SET`.
  - Log `INFO: mountd_compat: listening on ...` at startup.

  Operators monitoring listening ports or rpcbind registrations will
  see one new entry per MDS. NFSv4.1 / pNFS service on port 2049 is
  unaffected. To suppress the new listener entirely on a given host,
  set `mountd_compat_enabled = false` in `mds.conf`.

### Notes
Failure modes for the new responder are soft and non-service-affecting:
- Port 20048 already taken (e.g. host co-located with nfs-utils
  `rpc.mountd`): logs `WARN: mountd_compat: TCP bind ... failed`;
  daemon continues serving NFSv4.
- rpcbind not running: logs `WARN: rpcbind registration failed`;
  daemon continues serving. `showmount -e` cannot find the port via
  portmap until rpcbind is started, but direct-port clients still
  work.

## [v0.1.0-community] — 2026-04-29

Initial community release of pnfs-mds.

### Highlights
- NFSv4.1 / pNFS metadata server with flex-files layouts.
- Multi-MDS topology with referrals and partition map.
- RonDB-backed catalogue (distributed, multi-node).
- Inline-data acceleration for small files.
- Inode + dirent caches with negative-entry TTL.
- DS health monitoring, capacity probe, and round-robin placement.
- Module-extracted architecture: `resilver`, `rebalance`, `tiering`,
  `observability`, `replication`, `layout_cache`,
  `layout_commit_aggregator`, `ds_gc`, `ds_prealloc`, `wrr`, `quota`
  are all built as optional modules with public stubs in this
  edition; enable a real implementation by toggling the
  corresponding `ENABLE_<NAME>` CMake flag and supplying the source.
- Configuration via `/etc/pnfs-mds/mds.conf` (INI-style); see
  `docs/config-keys.md` and `mds.conf(5)`.

### Licensing
- MIT for the bulk of the source (see `LICENSE-MIT`).
- GPL-2.0 for `src/catalogue/catalogue_rondb_shim.cpp` (see
  `LICENSE-GPL-2.0`) — required because that file links against
  RonDB / NDB API headers, which are GPL-2.0.
- See `LICENSING.md` for the per-file rationale.
