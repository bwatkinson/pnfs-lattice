 * layout_commit_aggregator.h — Phase F of docs/hpc-nto1-plan.md
 * (v1 foundation).
 *
 * In-memory write-back aggregator for LAYOUTCOMMIT updates issued by
 * HPC-Shared inodes.  Replaces the synchronous per-LAYOUTCOMMIT NDB
 * row write with a per-fileid bucket that holds the running maximum
 * file size and the latest mtime; a periodic timer thread (default
 * 200 ms) flushes dirty buckets through a caller-supplied callback,
 * and four forced-flush triggers (DELETE, final close, strict
 * GETATTR, admin) cover the cases where the size value must be
 * persisted before the next observer sees it.
 *
 * v1 scope (this file).  Pure data-structure module + timer thread.
 * No callers inside the MDS yet — wiring into op_layoutcommit /
 * op_getattr / op_remove lands in a follow-up patch.  This matches
 * the v1 / integration split used for Phase D (layout_cache) and
 * Phase G (hpc_hint).
 *
 * Design.
 *
 *   - 16 shards, sharded by `fileid % LCA_SHARDS`.  Each shard owns
 *     its own pthread_mutex_t, chained hash table, and dirty list.
 *
 *   - Per-shard capacity = ceil(max_buckets / 16), with a per-shard
 *     floor of 4.  When the shard reaches capacity the LRU dirty
 *     bucket is force-flushed inline so a slow flush callback can
 *     never starve a hot bucket.  v1 keeps this simple — eviction
 *     of a clean bucket is also allowed because the next submit
 *     will rebuild its state.
 *
 *   - Merge semantics on submit:
 *       max_size      := max(current_size,   new_size)
 *       latest_mtime  := max(current_mtime, new_mtime)  (by tv_sec
 *                          then tv_nsec)
 *       dirty         := true
 *
 *   - Flush callback signature: layout_commit_flush_fn.  Returning
 *     non-zero indicates the persistence step failed and the
 *     bucket should be re-marked dirty (the snapshot is preserved
 *     for the next flush attempt).  The callback runs WITHOUT the
 *     shard's mutex held.
 *
 *   - Periodic flush: a single timer thread iterates every shard,
 *     collects each shard's dirty fileids under its mutex (briefly),
 *     and invokes the callback per fileid outside the mutex.  This
 *     lets concurrent submits proceed against unrelated buckets
 *     while an NDB-bound flush is in flight.
 *
 *   - Cross-MDS coherence.  v1 is per-MDS; multi-MDS deployments
 *     get a divergence window for HPC-Shared files until the next
 *     flush on each MDS.  Documented in docs/hpc-shared-files.md
 *     and bounded by the configured flush interval.
 *
 *   - Crash recovery.  The aggregator is purely in-memory; on
 *     daemon restart any unflushed updates are lost.  Phase F's
 *     master plan documents this — recovery is a DS-side scan
 *     against MDS_IFLAG_HPC_SHARED inodes (deferred to a focused
 *     follow-up).  v1 ships the aggregator behind an opt-in inode
 *     flag (HPC_SHARED) so non-HPC files continue to take the
 *     synchronous path.
 *
 * Thread safety.  All public functions are safe to call from
 * concurrent threads.  Each operation acquires exactly one shard's
 * mutex; the flush thread acquires shard mutexes in sequence (never
 * two at once).  Shutdown sequence: stop() joins the timer thread
 * before destroy() touches any shard state.
