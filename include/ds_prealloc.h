 * error so the CREATE caller can surface NFS4ERR_NOSPC to the

 * strictly additive surface that bypasses the per-DS pre-fill rings
 * (which carry one fileid per slot) and runs placement +
 * FH-capture synchronously per call.  See ds_prealloc.c for the
 * design notes.

 *  - On MDS_OK, @ref out->entries is heap-allocated and CALLER OWNS
 *    it.  Free via ds_prealloc_batch_result_destroy() once the
 *    catalogue persistence step (the wide fused CREATE) is either
 *    committed or rolled back.
 *  - On any error code, @ref out->entries is NULL and any DS-side
