 * ds_capacity.h — Live capacity probe for data servers.
 *
 * Periodically calls statvfs() on each DS's mount path (as configured
 * via ds_mount_path_fmt) and stamps the results onto the in-memory DS
 * cache so the WRR placement dispatcher sees real capacity instead of
 * the zero that 3rd-party DSes (NetApp, Isilon, Ceph, plain NFS)
 * report via the catalogue.
 *
 * Works on any mounted filesystem \u2014 statvfs() is the same syscall df(1)
 * uses.  No vendor assumptions, no protocol peeking: if the DS is
 * NFS-mountable (which it is by definition of being a DS) and the MDS
 * has it mounted (the default when proxy I/O is enabled), the probe
 * works.  On probe failure the DS capacity is left untouched and WRR
 * falls back to admin weights (Phase A) or uniform.
 *
 * Runs a single background thread that polls the whole list every
 * `poll_ms`.  Thread-safe; the cache writeback uses the cache's
 * existing rwlock.

 * @param mount_path_fmt   printf-style format with exactly one %u

 *                         sweeps.  0 disables the probe; the caller
 *                         gets a NULL @p *out and no thread runs.
